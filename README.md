A simple pixelart application

Description:
This is a simple WIP pixelart application. It's developed using pygame, which is far from optimal (preferably something likte SDL would have been used). The main focus of this project was not an optimized application but to structure a project and finish it within a lesser timeframe. It started as a sideproject for a bigger idea, where pixelart was needed.

Some of the challenges accounted was to structure everything properly, so that future implementations could work well with previous ones. The application is therefore essentially an application builder with dedicated objects to position and place elements on screen. The implementation is a pixelart application, but the internal framework could be used to make other types of applications, which I certainly will do in the future.
